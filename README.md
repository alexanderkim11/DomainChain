- [Homeworks](hws/readme.html) ([md](hws/readme.md)) that are in development
- [Collab home page](collab/home.html) ([md](collab/home.md)); run `make` in that directory to create the .html version
- [Ethereum blockchain explorer](explorer/readme.html) ([md](explorer/readme.md))

To run the auto-formatter: run `npm install` and then you can call the autoformatter on every `.sol` file in the repo with `npm run format`. The `.prettierrc.json` file is there to prevent the autoformatter from turning functions/function calls into a bunch of wrapped lines by manually extending the maximum possible line length.
